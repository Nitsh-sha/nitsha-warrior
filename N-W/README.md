# Your Project's Name

This is a responsive website showcasing my fitness personal training services focusing mainly on female clients. All services are catered to fitness needs of modern women including pre and postnatal rehabilitation, strength training, and weight loss. The website also shows sample workout clips as well as trainer’s brief biography and fitness philosophy. Audience can contact to request further information or click to social media links to see other references.


## UX
 This website is for women who are health conscious and who strive to achieve healthy lifestyle. The colour-theme is clean, fun/vibrant yet feminine. The website has a clean look which is easy on the eye.


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

This is a one-page website. As the user open the website, firstly, section home will appear. The user is shown a short video of the trainer exercising which gives the user immediate understanding of the purpose of the website and what type of exercise method the trainer is specialised in. In this home section, there is also a clear statement emphasizing the focus on female fitness and an action button indicating that the user wants to transform herself physically.

When clicking the action button, the user is then led to the next section showing different services provided, followed by trainer’s bio and client reviews. After that the user is shown additional working videos and then contact details in order to request further information from the trainer.
